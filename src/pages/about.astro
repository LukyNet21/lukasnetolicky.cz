        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
          Hey! I'm a 17-year-old student at <a
            href="https://www.delta-skola.cz/"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer">DELTA IT High School</a
          > in the Czech Republic, where I learn all sorts of tech skills. When
          I'm not in class, I like to work on personal coding projects and learn
          new technologies that help me build useful solutions.

        <h2>How I Got Started</h2>
        <p>
          I got into coding back in 2020 with some small projects that
          interested me. What started as just playing around quickly turned into
          a bigger hobby as I discovered I could create software that I actually
          used but couldn't find anywhere else. The feeling of building
          something that solves a real problem is what keeps me going!
        </p>
        <p>
          These days, I mostly build web apps. I like to create solutions for
          problems I face - if I need something that doesn't exist yet, I'll
          just build it myself. This hands-on approach is how I learn best,
          picking up different technologies, languages and frameworks along the
          way as needed to turn my ideas into reality.
